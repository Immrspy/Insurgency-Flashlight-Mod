# Insurgency-Flashlight-Mod
I am not responsible if you get banned for using these, so don't complain to me.
It uses default controls for Insurgency to add some Macros.
They will not trigger if you are not in the Insurgency window, they will if you use the Steam Overlay

Left Click is a dual-stage tirgger. Holding Shift will (accidentally) disable this.

Right Click will toggle flashlight, and look down sights

Middle Click will resupply. (If you can't resupply, it will open the menu)

Mouse_4 will spam the flashlight

Numpad0 will Call out an RPG in team chat

Numpad1 will Call out "Destroying cache" in team chat
